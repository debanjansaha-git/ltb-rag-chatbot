The Legal Aid Chatbot is designed to provide instant legal assistance for landlord and tenant disputes in Ontario.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Employs RAG techniques to fetch relevant information and generate responses based on a rich database of legal documents.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use chat interface that allows users to input their legal questions and receive advice instantly.
